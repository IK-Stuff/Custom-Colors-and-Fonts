# Custom-Colors-and-Fonts
A simple little script to change the fonts and colors for text, buttons, and other things on Discord using QuickCSS
--------------
All the font related stuff is from line 10 to 694, colors are underneath that
Comments themselves are not organized to tell you what's what, but the starting comment is a good way to figure out what the fonts are, so mess with that as you please
