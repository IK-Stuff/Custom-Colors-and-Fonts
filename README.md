# Custom-Colors-and-Fonts
A simple little script to change the fonts and colors for text, buttons, and other things on Discord using QuickCSS
--------------
All the font related stuff is from line 10 to 694, colors are underneath that
Comments themselves are not organized to tell you what's what, but the starting comment is a good way to figure out what the fonts are, so mess with that as you please
Also, if you wish to use the fonts I've listed in the code, you'll need to download and install them, then restart your system so they become recognized fonts (I've learned this the hard way)
